Maths is probably the hardest of the lessons I have taken. I chose it as it is a very good supporting subject to both physics and computer science and I enjoy being challenged by new problems and learning how to solve them in different ways. We are studying the C1, C2 and D1 modules in the first year of our course and C3, C4 and s1 for our second year. As I wish to study computer science at university my maths result is going to be very important and I’m aiming for an A*!
So far my favourite module has been D1 as many of the problems that we get are similar to computer algorithms or have nice logical solutions.
