Physics for me is a very interesting lesson as I get to learn about how thing work, move, transfer energy and much more. This intrigues me as I like to understand what is going on around me or at least to be able to make a somewhat logical theory! I chose physics for that very reason I’m inquisitive! We learn about a veriety of topicas vairying from waves to electricity and many more. my favourite topic so far has been electricity as learning about circuits and appliences is really enjoyable and I get to picture what might be going on inside different things.
