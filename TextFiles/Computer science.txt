Computer science is by far my favourite lesson that I have chosen to study. In fact, I chose my college as the provided a computer science course. I spend a lot of time on my computer and so learning about how they work, connect, are built and coded are all things that interest me greatly. Although I enjoy the theory side, I much prefer the coding that we do, as it allows me to make logical solutions to problems or create simple applications! I currently understand HTML, CSS some basic Javascript and Visual basic to a decent level. However, I'm currently looking to teach myself Java as I'm certain it will be very useful in the coming years.
