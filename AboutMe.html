	<br>
	<br>
	My name is Harii! I am currently 16 years old and have started studying maths, physics and computer science at Hereford Sixth Form College.
	<br>
	<br>
	I live in Earlswood a small rural community in south Wales near to the city of Newport. Currently my house is shared by my mother, aunt, uncle, two cousins, cat and both grandparents so the house can be quite busy!
	<br>
	<br>
	My main interests involve computers weather it is playing video games, creating videos or coding I enjoy every second in contact with the machines and hope that I might be able to study computer science at university, and then find a career in the computing industry however I'm yet to find the area that I will focus on.
	<br>
	<br>
	I have a few other hobbies which i honestly havn't visited in a while this includes, badminton, swimming and drawing. These used to be regular activities for me however due to my house location their accessability is rather limited for me, except drawing! That one is less location dependant.
	<br>
	<br>
	Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy my website!
